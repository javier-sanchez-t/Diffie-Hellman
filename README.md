# Diffie-Hellman
Algorithm cryptography

# Programming language:
Java

# How does it work?
The program takes the size of the prime number p (in bits) as an argument during execution. Based on the size of p, is able to compute and print the values of p, the generator g, random numbers a, b ∈ Z∗p, and other intermediate results computed in the Diffie-Hellman protocol. 
Note that the values of p, g, a, and b are generated randomly based on the input argument. 
The program finally shows the shared key generated.
